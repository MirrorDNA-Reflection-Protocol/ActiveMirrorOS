### Policy
- We prioritize user sovereignty and data privacy.
- Vulnerabilities exposing user data or allowing unconsented identity drift are Critical.
- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.

## ⟡ Trust by Design
Our architecture is local-first. Most "exploits" are mitigated by the fact that the user holds the keys and the data.
