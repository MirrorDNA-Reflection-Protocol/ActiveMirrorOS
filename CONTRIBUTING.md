# Contributing to MirrorDNA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the MirrorDNA ecosystem. We are building the **Constitutional Protocol for Reflective AI**.

## ⟡ Our Philosophy
1.  **Trust by Design**: Users own their identity. No data farming.
2.  **Continuity**: Systems must preserve context across sessions.
3.  **Reflection**: AI should mirror the user, not predict them.

## 🛠 How to Contribute
We welcome PRs that align with these values.

1.  **Fork the Repo**: Create your feature branch.
2.  **Check Compliance**: Ensure your changes align with `MirrorDNA-Standard` (Level 1 min).
3.  **Run Tests**: If applicable, run `pytest` or verification scripts.
4.  **Submit PR**: Describe *why* this change improves the ecosystem.

## ⚠️ Safety
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets.
- Never commit PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
- Respect the `LICENSE`.

## ⟡ Governance
This project is governed by **Active MirrorOS™** standards. Major architectural changes require approval from the maintainers.

*Identity belongs to the user.*
