## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is the core free?

We believe AI memory should be a fundamental building block, not a paid service. Making it open source:
- Enables innovation
- Builds trust (you can audit the code)
- Creates a better ecosystem
- Aligns with our values

We monetize through **optional** support and services, not the core technology.

### Will features be moved behind paywalls?

**No.** Core features remain free forever:
- Session management
- Storage backends
- Reflective patterns (LingOS Lite)
- Encryption
- Example apps

Paid tiers only add:
- Support services
- Team collaboration features
- Optional hosted version
- Advanced/experimental features (LingOS Pro)

If we add a paid feature, there will always be a free alternative path.

### Can I build a commercial product without paying?

**Yes!** MIT license allows commercial use with zero fees. Build and sell products freely.

You might want paid support for:
- Faster bug fixes
- Custom features
- Training your team
- Peace of mind (SLA)

But it's 100% optional.

### What happens if I stop paying (Team/Enterprise)?

Your code continues to work! You keep:
- ✓ Full SDK access (it's open source)
- ✓ All your data
- ✓ Community support

You lose:
- Priority support
- Team-specific features
- Custom development

No lock-in, ever.

### Do you offer academic/nonprofit discounts?

Yes! For qualified organizations:
- **Team tier**: 50% off ($24.50/month)
- **Enterprise tier**: Custom pricing

Contact us with:
- Organization details
- Use case description
- Tax-exempt status (if applicable)
