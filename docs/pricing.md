## Cost Comparison

### vs. Building Custom

**Building from scratch:**
- 4-8 weeks of development ($20k-$80k)
- Ongoing maintenance (10-20 hours/month)
- Testing and bug fixes
- No advanced features

**ActiveMirrorOS Free:**
- Ready in hours
- No maintenance burden
- 83 tests included
- Free forever

**Even Pro tier** is cheaper than one month of custom development.

---

### vs. Cloud AI Services

**OpenAI API:**
- GPT-4: ~$0.03/1k tokens
- 1M tokens = $30
- No built-in memory (you build it)

**ActiveMirrorOS + Local LLM:**
- One-time cost: Free (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Monthly cost: $0 (self-hosted)
- Built-in memory: ✅

**ActiveMirrorOS + OpenAI:**
- ActiveMirrorOS: Free (Lite) or $9-19/mo (Pro)
- OpenAI: Same API costs
- But: Better memory, reflection, continuity

---

## Pricing Roadmap

### When does pricing take effect?

**Current (v0.2.0):** Everything is free

**Q1 2025:** LingOS Pro beta (free early access)

**Q2 2025:** LingOS Pro launches (paid tiers available)

**Future:** Potential cloud hosting option (optional, separate pricing)

---

### Will free users be grandfathered?

**Yes.** If you're using Lite today, it stays free forever.

**Yes**, but:
- We'll announce changes 90 days in advance
